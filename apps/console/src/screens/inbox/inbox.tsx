 * Calls read as threads. The threads are the calls Calls hands it — the org's, or the agent in
 * view's, through the status picked — grouped by who was on them: a contact who talked to two
 * agents is ONE thread, and its agent is whoever took the newest call. The URL names a call, and
 * the thread holding it is the one open: THE CALL, drawn exactly one way — the chat, the transcript
 * with every tool call, or the log; the desk on a live one, which is where a supervisor works; its
 * verdict on one that is over — with the person after the call's own panels, and their other
 * conversations there, each one click from being the call shown. In focus the list folds away and
 * the call has the screen. What the gateway keeps per contact on top of that — names, what is
 * unread, a call back, writing into a closed thread — is per agent, so it is drawn with one agent
 * in view and only then.
